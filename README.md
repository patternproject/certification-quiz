# Key features include:
Ideal for self-paced learning, this tool helps users identify weak areas and track their improvement over multiple quiz sessions.

### Customizable Quiz Parameters : 
Users can specify N (total questions) from a pool and M (total time in minutes).
### Timer Integration : 
Tracks elapsed time with a countdown clock, ensuring quizzes are time-bound.
### Detailed Reports : 
At the end of each quiz, generates a report showing:
Number of correct answers (A out of N).
A list of all questions with user answers, correct answers, and explanations for incorrect responses.
### Question Bank : 
Questions are stored in a structured format (CSV/JSON) for easy updates and scalability.
### Progress Tracking : 
Tracks user progress over time, storing historical quiz results (scores, timestamps, and incorrect answers) in a CSV/JSON file.
### Tech Stack : 
Built using Python for backend logic and optionally React/Vite for a frontend interface. Progress and quiz data are stored locally in CSV/JSON files for simplicity.
